            You can assess or visit our website at any time without informing us
            who you are or providing us with any personal information. However,
            we may collect information at our websites in two ways: (1) directly
            (for example, when you provide information, such as your name, email
            address, designation, company, country, and telephone number, to
            sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website);
            and (2) indirectly (for example, through our website’s technology,
            we may collect certain information such as your IP address,
            demographics, your computer’s operating system, and browser type).
            We do not attempt to track your personal information to identify you
            but gather this contact information to make up the web traffic
            routing, to diagnose problems with server for the administration of
            our website, to understand better how you interact with our website
            and services, and to re-design and upgrade the website for better
            use. If you choose not to provide the mandatory personal information
            to process your request, we may not be able to provide the
            corresponding service.
